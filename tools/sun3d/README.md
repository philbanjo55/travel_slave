# Teton Sun Preview (concept demo)

A one-page 3D look at the Tetons from a few stops, lit by the calculated sun for 30 Dec 2026.
Artifact: https://claude.ai/artifact/Pb98xc4aXLU43cuyTcVxTU. No Google data in it.

- `page.src.html`: the page. `/*__SUN__*/` is replaced by `sun.js`, `/*__APP__*/` by `app.js`.
  It loads three.js r128 from cdnjs and fetches `teton-dem.png`, published beside the page.
- `build_dem.py <dir>`: builds `teton-dem.png` (2048 x 2048, one point every ~27 m, lat 43.45-43.95,
  lng -110.92 to -110.24) from the public terrarium elevation tiles at zoom 12
  (`https://s3.amazonaws.com/elevation-tiles-prod/terrarium/12/<x>/<y>.png`, x 785-793,
  y 1490-1498, saved as `<dir>/tiles/12_<x>_<y>.png`). The PNG holds prediction residuals
  (left + up - upleft, half-metre steps above 1500 m, filter 0), so the page decodes it exactly
  with `DecompressionStream`. It is not kept in the repo (2.3 MB): rebuild it.
- `app.js`: heights go to the graphics card as two half-float channels; one pass lights every
  point (snow / rock / forest colour, sun angle, shadows marched toward the sun) into a 2048 px
  light map whenever the time changes; the terrain mesh just shows that map. First / last light
  and "where you stand" are point checks on the CPU.
- Sun times are a few minutes off: the sun never counts before the flat-horizon sunrise, and
  terrain outside the area casts no shadow.
